# MovieRental

This is a project started on the 20 december 2020. The main purpose of this project is to find out what is undestood and what need to be seen again or learned concerning DAL and API in C# (dotnet).
To start, we were given a project database and a postdeployement script to enter some entries in the database before usage.
